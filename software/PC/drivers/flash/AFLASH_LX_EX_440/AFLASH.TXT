Recommended Flash EPROM (BIOS) Management & Updating Procedures
============================================================================
New Features of AFLASH:
1. Support 1M or 2M Bits Flash EPROM.
2. Compare  "BIOS Version",  "Chipset and Model"  and  "Date of BIOS Built" 
   between the current and updated BIOS. If any of above items doesn't match
   , it will give you the warning message.  

Upon first use of the computer system:
1. Create a bootable system floppy diskette by typing [FORMAT A:/S] from the
   DOS prompt without creating "AUTOEXEC.BAT" and "CONFIG.SYS" files.

2. Copy AFLASH.EXE to your new diskette.

3. Run  AFLASH.EXE from your new diskette and select option 1  "Save Current
   BIOS To File."  Please Enter File Name to Save:(Current File).

Updating BIOS procedures (only when necessary):
-> IMPORTANT:  Flash Memory Type maybe  "AMD Am29F002NT".  If  "UNKNOWN"  is 
   displayed after "Flash Memory:" then this ROM chip is not programmable or
   not supported with the PnP BIOS and therefore cannot be programmed by the
   Flash Memory Writer.

   AFLASH will check the file and flash type whether parameter block matches
   or not 8K4K4K and 16K8K8K.

1. Download an updated ASUS BIOS file from the internet (WWW), FTP, or a BBS
   (Bulletin Board Service) and save to the diskette you created above.  See
   ASUS CONTACT INFORMATION on Page II of the User's Manual for more details.

2. Turn off your computer and open the system cabinet to Enable  "Boot Block 
   Programming" jumper as shown in section III of the User's Manual.

3. Boot from the floppy diskette you created above.  

4. At the "A:\" prompt, type: [AFLASH] and then the <Enter> key.

5. Enter 2 "Update BIOS Including Boot Block and ESCD" from the Main Menu.

6. The  program  displays  a second screen prompting you for the name of the
   BIOS file.  Type in the complete file name and extension of the new BIOS,
   and  then  press the <Enter> key.  The utility then uploads the BIOS file
   from disk.

   WARNING: If you encounter problems while downloading the new BIOS, DO NOT
   turn off your system since this might prevent your system from booting up.
   Just  repeat the process,  and if the problem still persists,  upload the
   original  BIOS  file you saved to disk above.  If the Flash Memory Writer
   utility was not able to successfully download a complete BIOS file,  your
   system may not be able to boot up. If this happens, your system will need
   service from your vendor.

7. After  successfully downloading the new BIOS file,  exit the Flash Memory
   Writer utility and then turn off your system.  Set the jumper back to its
   default setting of Programming "Disabled or Protected."

8. Turn on your computer and hold down the <Delete> key to enter BIOS setup.
   You must select "Setup Default" to affect the new BIOS,  then you may set
   other items from the Main Menu.
