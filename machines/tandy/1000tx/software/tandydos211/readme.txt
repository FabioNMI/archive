
 MS-DOS v2.11 (for Tandy 1000) - Released by BAD AiR ABANDONWARE...
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ahh, another tasty tidbit from BAD AiR ABANDONWARE... does your
  Tandy 1000 need an operating system? No? TOO BAD - you've already
  downloaded this one, so you'd might as well install it and make
  good use of it!

  Instructions for installing this operating system:

   1. Download & Install MAXIDISK (download from http://badair.cjb.net/).
   2. Use MAXIDISK to install the HDK file to a 360kb 5.25" diskette.
   3. Insert your new disk into your Tandy 1000 and let it boot!
   4. NOTE: THIS OPERATING SYSTEM WILL *NOT* WORK ON IBM PC XTs/ATs!!!
